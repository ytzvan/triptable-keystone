1
00:00:00,777 --> 00:00:02,946
Previously on Game of Thrones...

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:08,050
Surrender by nightfall,
or this ends with blood.

3
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,818
We all die today.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:11,586
We don't need to die,
not if we have help.

5
00:00:11,688 --> 00:00:14,689
You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

6
00:00:16,961 --> 00:00:18,060
We're going to have a baby.

7
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:20,695
A reckoning will come,

8
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,397
we need the North to face it.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,932
The entire North.

10
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,301
I have a team of men after them.

11
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:29,304
They won't get far.

12
00:00:31,142 --> 00:00:34,176
Lady Sansa, I will give my
life for yours if need be.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,814
Theon disobeyed my orders.

14
00:00:39,283 --> 00:00:40,949
The boy's a fool.

15
00:00:41,285 --> 00:00:43,652
He is my brother. He's Greyjoy.

16
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:46,822
Karstarks are North men.

17
00:00:47,324 --> 00:00:49,324
They won't forgive the
killing of their Lord.

18
00:00:54,364 --> 00:00:55,898
Stand and fight blind girl.

19
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:00,735
See you tomorrow.

20
00:01:04,508 --> 00:01:07,109
We won't be sailing to
Westeros any time soon.

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,414
They're dragons, Khaleesi,
they can never be tamed.

22
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:34,169
You're a warg, Bran. It's in your blood.

23
00:01:35,739 --> 00:01:36,738
He waits for you.

24
00:01:38,608 --> 00:01:40,309
You're the three-eyed raven.

26
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:27,064
Give him another go, Ned.

27
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:29,100
That's my father.

28
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,402
And my Uncle Benjen.

29
00:04:31,505 --> 00:04:34,572
Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

30
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:45,082
They were all so happy.

31
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:48,186
So were you once.

32
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,727
Stop showing off.

33
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:58,396
Lyanna!

34
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:00,198
My Aunt Lyanna.

35
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,700
I've seen her statue in the crypt.

36
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,204
My father never talked about her.

37
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:14,779
Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.

38
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:19,050
Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

39
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,218
I don't know.

40
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,886
What about him?

41
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,523
Wylis, come here.

42
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,763
Hodor?

43
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,865
But he's got giant's blood.

44
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,503
And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

45
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:41,206
Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

46
00:05:41,308 --> 00:05:44,075
And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

47
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,244
Hodor talks?

48
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,452
You leave the fighting to
the little lords, Wylis.

49
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,021
Come along, now. It's no place for you.

50
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,624
Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

51
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,992
If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

52
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:05,096
Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

53
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,031
So leave him be.

54
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:09,400
It is time to go.

55
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:11,502
Please, a little longer.

56
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:27,285
You finally show me
something I care about

57
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:28,886
and then you drag me away.

58
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:32,657
It is beautiful beneath the sea,

59
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,025
but if you stay too long, you'll drown.

60
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,136
I wasn't drowning.

61
00:06:37,137 --> 00:06:38,889
I was home.

62
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:54,545
Wylis.

63
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,314
Hodor.

64
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,115
I saw you as a boy.

65
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,051
You could talk.

66
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,721
What happened?

67
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,690
Hodor.

68
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:11,663
Where's Meera?

69
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:15,800
Hodor.

70
00:07:23,862 --> 00:07:33,077
FROM (TUSUB)(TITULO.c)OM

71
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,594
You shouldn't be here.

72
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:46,397
It's not safe outside the cave.

73
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,199
It's not safe anywhere.

74
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,904
I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

75
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,106
- Hodor.
- His real name is Wylis.

76
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,345
And he could talk and fight and...
and then...

77
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,680
What's wrong?

78
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,820
The Three-Eyed Raven says
there's a war coming.

79
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,088
And we're going to fight it in there?

80
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,653
Brandon Stark needs you.

81
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,725
For what? I sit in there

82
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,127
and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

83
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,797
He isn't going to stay here forever.

84
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,333
And out there he needs you.

85
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,995
It's time, Ser Davos.

86
00:09:25,097 --> 00:09:27,432
Open the door and the men inside

87
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:29,801
can rejoin their brothers in peace.

88
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:39,844
We'll even set the wolf free north
of the Wall where it belongs.

89
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,483
Nobody needs to die tonight.

90
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,522
I've never been much of a fighter.

91
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,865
Apologies for what you're about to see.

92
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,874
Come on.

93
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,155
Attack!

94
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,198
Fight, you cowards!

95
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,499
You fucking traitor.

96
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:44,702
The only traitors here are the ones

97
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,772
who shoved their knives into
their Lord Commander's heart.

98
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,341
For thousands of years the Night's Watch

99
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,078
has held Castle Black
against the wildlings.

100
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,213
Until you.

101
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:09,193
Throw them into the cells
where they belong.

102
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:44,328
Took a lot of knives.

103
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,067
I'll have my men get
the wood for a fire.

104
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:52,870
Bodies to burn.

105
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:03,881
Hey.

106
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,518
Right, so there she is, high
and mighty Queen Cersei,

107
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,754
tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

108
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:12,857
All of a sudden she looks my way.

109
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,826
Gives me a little smile like, "Well?"

110
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:18,362
So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

111
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:21,132
and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

112
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,101
She's never seen anything like it.

113
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,570
I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

114
00:13:26,673 --> 00:13:28,873
Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

115
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,745
She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

116
00:13:35,882 --> 00:13:37,447
Well, you all know me.

117
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,583
You know I wouldn't lie about this.

118
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,929
Get out of my way.

119
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:00,998
King's orders, Your Grace.

120
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,836
What are the king's orders?

121
00:15:05,938 --> 00:15:08,739
He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

122
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,107
for your own protection.

123
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,711
You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

124
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:18,849
Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

125
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:22,519
I would like to speak to my son.

126
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:25,055
He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

127
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:52,378
EXCLUSIVE FROM -T-U-S-U-B-T-IT-U-L-O-.C-O-M

128
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:57,521
She grew up.

129
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,623
Almost.

130
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,359
Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

131
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,864
I expect it was Mother.

132
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,933
Your mother wouldn't do that.

133
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,367
Yes, she would.

134
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:15,539
Are you angry with her?

135
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,542
- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

136
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,345
She has every right to be here.

137
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:25,983
They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

138
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:30,287
- If she had tried... - They're not
putting your mother in a cell ever again.

139
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,356
Not while I'm here.

140
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:37,361
Why haven't you gone to see her?

141
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,400
Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

142
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,870
Don't you think I know that?

143
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:51,608
I'm sorry.

144
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,445
But I can't.

145
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:56,914
Why not?

146
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,919
When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

147
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,888
what did I do?

148
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:09,159
When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

149
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:11,061
what did I do?

150
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:14,531
We all fail sometimes.

151
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:18,002
The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

152
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:23,474
If I can't even protect my own wife
or my own mother, what good am I?

153
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,510
Go and see your mother and
ask her to forgive you.

154
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:31,181
Your Grace.

155
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:32,983
Lord Commander.

156
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,819
I want to see my wife.

157
00:17:35,922 --> 00:17:38,255
The gods wait for Queen Margaery

158
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,758
to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

159
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,795
The king must wait as well.

160
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,331
Go and see your mother, Tommen.

161
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,709
You're a bold man.

162
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,947
On the contrary.

163
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,649
I fear a great deal.

164
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,919
The Father, the Mother,

165
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:11,155
the Warrior.

166
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,301
Do you know why we use these stones?

167
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,872
To remind us not to fear death.

168
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:32,242
We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

169
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:34,578
You must long for the next life.

170
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:38,115
In truth, I fear that, too.

171
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,151
You imprisoned and humiliated my sister.

172
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,887
Your sister sought the gods' mercy

173
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,755
and atoned for her sin.

174
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,058
What about my sins?

175
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:53,864
I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

176
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:58,168
I killed my own cousin.

177
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,204
When the gods judged my brother guilty,

178
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,606
I helped him escape their justice.

179
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:06,877
What atonement do I deserve?

180
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:11,515
You would spill blood
in this holy place?

181
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:14,051
Oh, the gods won't mind.

182
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,586
They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

183
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,724
Go on, then.

184
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,428
I deserve it. We all do.

185
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,131
We are weak, vain creatures.

186
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:30,100
We live only by the Mother's mercy.

187
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,419
They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

188
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,387
I don't.

189
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,390
They'd never reach me before you struck.

190
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,159
I've fought against worse odds.

191
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:58,228
No doubt many of us would fall.

192
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,365
But who are we?

193
00:20:01,467 --> 00:20:04,134
We have no names, no family.

194
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,138
Every one of us is poor and powerless.

195
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
And yet together,

196
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,410
we can overthrow an empire.

197
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,309
Mother.

198
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:59,689
Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

199
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,926
Gold.

200
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:05,496
Good. It was always her color.

201
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,034
I'm sorry for keeping you here.

202
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,805
I shouldn't have, but I was...

203
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,645
I didn't want to lose you again.

204
00:21:21,747 --> 00:21:23,547
I understand.

205
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:27,551
I'm glad to see you.

206
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,290
I know I should have come sooner.

207
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:36,726
I wanted to. I was wrong.

208
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,030
It's all right.

209
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,035
No, it isn't.

210
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:49,473
I should have executed all of them.

211
00:21:49,575 --> 00:21:51,375
I should have pulled down the sept

212
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:55,546
onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

213
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,947
as you would have for me.

214
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:01,618
You raised me to be strong...

215
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:05,389
and I wasn't.

216
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:08,858
But I want to be.

217
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,263
Help me.

218
00:22:17,636 --> 00:22:19,303
Always.

219
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:50,234
If I lost my cock, I'd
drink all the time.

220
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,707
Meaning no offense.

221
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:59,610
He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

222
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:00,977
I do not make dwarf jokes.

223
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,179
You think them.

224
00:23:03,282 --> 00:23:07,718
So, the fleet. It's been burned.

225
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,622
We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

226
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:14,157
Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

227
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,327
Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

228
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,063
Perhaps they can tell us their secret.

229
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,633
The Masters have retaken both cities.

230
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:27,371
Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

231
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:33,443
What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

232
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:35,279
They are not eating.

233
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:38,148
They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

234
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,950
Daenerys is the dragon queen.

235
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:43,887
Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

236
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,324
If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

237
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,693
Dragons do not do well in captivity.

238
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:52,162
- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

239
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:55,198
I drink and I know things.

240
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,404
The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

241
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:03,006
ranged over hundreds of miles.

242
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:07,912
Then Daenerys's ancestors
started chaining them up in pens.

243
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,879
A few generations later,

244
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,650
the last dragons were
no larger than cats.

245
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,687
They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

246
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,223
Missandei,

247
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,860
how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

248
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:27,631
- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

249
00:24:27,733 --> 00:24:29,733
Never.

250
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:32,001
Dragons are intelligent.

251
00:24:32,103 --> 00:24:34,938
More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

252
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,907
They have affection for their friends

253
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,707
and fury for their enemies.

254
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:42,912
- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

255
00:24:43,014 --> 00:24:46,048
They will. It's time
they had their supper.

256
00:24:46,248 --> 00:24:58,010
BY (TU-SUB-TI-TU-L-O.C-OM.)

257
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:19,408
I'm friends with your mother.

258
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,885
I'm here to help.

259
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:31,053
Don't eat the help.

260
00:26:35,826 --> 00:26:37,226
When I was a child,

261
00:26:37,328 --> 00:26:40,963
an uncle asked what gift I
wanted for my name day.

262
00:26:41,065 --> 00:26:43,665
I begged him for one of you.

263
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,270
"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

264
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,340
"It could be little like me."

265
00:26:58,049 --> 00:27:02,184
Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

266
00:27:03,521 --> 00:27:05,721
Then my father told me

267
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:09,758
the last dragon had died a century ago.

268
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:12,962
I cried myself to sleep that night.

269
00:27:22,006 --> 00:27:23,973
But here you are.

270
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:34,110
Next time I have an idea like that,

271
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,978
punch me in the face.

272
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:51,827
What's your name?

273
00:28:58,302 --> 00:29:00,369
What's your name?

274
00:29:00,471 --> 00:29:03,839
- No one.
- I don't believe that.

275
00:29:03,941 --> 00:29:06,675
You don't believe that.

276
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,109
Who are you?

277
00:29:41,745 --> 00:29:42,744
No one.

278
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:45,247
If a girl says her name,

279
00:29:45,349 --> 00:29:48,350
a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

280
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:50,752
A girl has no name.

281
00:29:50,854 --> 00:29:53,089
If a girl says her name,

282
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:55,257
a man will feed her tonight.

283
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,793
A girl has no name.

284
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:00,862
If a girl says her name,

285
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,299
a man will give her eyes back.

286
00:30:05,035 --> 00:30:07,303
A girl has no name.

287
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:17,012
Come.

288
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,256
Leave it.

289
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:30,426
A girl is not a beggar anymore.

290
00:30:38,869 --> 00:30:41,703
We came upon the bodies on our way here.

291
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:46,308
Half a dozen men? Your best hunters?

292
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,076
They obviously had help.

293
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:51,079
I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

294
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,650
Thank you for this
report, Lord Karstark.

295
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,119
We know where she's going.

296
00:30:57,221 --> 00:30:58,954
Her brother's at Castle Black.

297
00:30:59,056 --> 00:31:00,756
Ned Stark's last surviving son?

298
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,924
Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

299
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:06,094
So was I, Father.

300
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,264
Your hold on the North
will never be secure

301
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,633
as long as a Stark can
walk through that door.

302
00:31:10,734 --> 00:31:13,335
Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

303
00:31:13,437 --> 00:31:17,306
And the few men left are barely men
at all. Farm boys and thieves.

304
00:31:17,408 --> 00:31:21,343
With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow...

305
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:24,380
Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

306
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,149
You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

307
00:31:28,886 --> 00:31:30,919
We don't need every house in the North.

308
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,622
The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks

309
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:37,593
command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

310
00:31:37,695 --> 00:31:40,629
With their support, none
could challenge us.

311
00:31:40,731 --> 00:31:44,733
The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

312
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:47,803
It's time for new blood in the North.

313
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,615
If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

314
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:01,517
you'll be treated as a mad dog.

315
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,486
Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

316
00:32:05,856 --> 00:32:07,756
My lords.

317
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:10,226
Lady Walda has given birth.

318
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:12,294
A boy.

319
00:32:12,396 --> 00:32:14,896
Red-cheeked and healthy.

320
00:32:14,998 --> 00:32:18,200
My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

321
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,311
Congratulations, Father.

322
00:32:30,814 --> 00:32:33,549
I look forward to
meeting my new brother.

323
00:32:37,988 --> 00:32:40,456
You'll always be my firstborn.

324
00:32:41,925 --> 00:32:44,192
Thank you for saying that.

325
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,528
It means a great deal to me.

326
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:25,301
Maester Wolkan,

327
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:29,237
send ravens to all the northern houses.
Roose Bolton is dead.

328
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:33,074
Poisoned by our enemies.

329
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,450
How did he die?

330
00:33:45,122 --> 00:33:47,823
Poisoned by his enemies.

331
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:50,793
You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

332
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:54,062
Forgive me, my lord.

333
00:33:57,335 --> 00:33:59,267
Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

334
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,871
She's resting, my lord.

335
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,276
At once, my lord.

336
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:35,136
There he is.

337
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,172
Isn't he wonderful?

338
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:42,644
May I hold him?

339
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:46,081
Of... of course.

340
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,093
Little brother.

341
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:01,129
Lord Bolton sent for us.

342
00:35:01,231 --> 00:35:02,865
Have you seen him?

343
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,643
Of course. Follow me, Mother.

344
00:35:32,129 --> 00:35:34,062
Where is Lord Bolton?

345
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:46,107
Down!

346
00:35:46,209 --> 00:35:49,110
It's all right. Come on.

347
00:35:49,212 --> 00:35:52,648
It's cold out here, Ramsay.
I need to feed him.

348
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:01,890
Ramsay, where is your father?

349
00:36:03,226 --> 00:36:04,893
Ramsay.

350
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:14,903
Where is Lord Bolton?

351
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,512
I am Lord Bolton.

352
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,524
Ramsay.

353
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,325
Ramsay, please.

354
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:40,028
I'll leave Winterfell. I'll
go back to the Riverlands.

355
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,402
Please.

356
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:49,471
Ramsay.

357
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,208
He's your brother.

358
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:58,680
I prefer being an only child.

359
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,870
I saw her with a man.

360
00:37:21,972 --> 00:37:23,805
I don't think he hurt her.

361
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,009
She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

362
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,979
You don't know which way she went?

363
00:37:31,081 --> 00:37:33,348
I spent three days looking for her.

364
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:34,917
She disappeared.

365
00:37:37,287 --> 00:37:38,754
How'd she look?

366
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,023
She looked good.

367
00:37:41,124 --> 00:37:44,092
She wasn't exactly dressed like a lady.

368
00:37:45,495 --> 00:37:47,128
No, she wouldn't be.

369
00:37:49,299 --> 00:37:51,199
What happened at Winterfell?

370
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:06,481
I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

371
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,517
It was a difficult choice, my lady.

372
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,292
We've all had to make difficult choices.

373
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:39,047
We shouldn't be lighting fires.

374
00:38:39,149 --> 00:38:40,215
It's not safe.

375
00:38:40,317 --> 00:38:41,650
He won't stop hunting us.

376
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,418
We just have to make it to Castle Black.

377
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,988
Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

378
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,924
Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

379
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,692
I won't let him.

380
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,761
I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

381
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:57,799
And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

382
00:38:57,901 --> 00:39:01,569
And the truth about Ser
Rodrik, who I beheaded.

383
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,574
And the truth about
Robb, who I betrayed.

384
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:11,046
When you take the black, all
your crimes are forgiven.

385
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,948
I don't want to be forgiven.

386
00:39:15,485 --> 00:39:19,041
I can never make amends to
your family for the things I've done.

387
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,424
They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

388
00:39:28,165 --> 00:39:30,766
You're not coming with us?

389
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:36,237
I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

390
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,307
I would have died to get you there.

391
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,560
May I take one of the horses?

392
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,299
Where will you go?

393
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,970
Home.

394
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,717
The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte.

395
00:40:21,819 --> 00:40:24,052
And the ironborn who held it?

396
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:27,355
They died fighting to a man.

397
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,159
What is dead may never die.

398
00:40:31,261 --> 00:40:33,461
What is dead may never die.

399
00:40:33,563 --> 00:40:35,563
But they did

400
00:40:35,665 --> 00:40:38,333
and our invasion died with them.

401
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,569
Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

402
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:43,304
Then we will take more.

403
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:46,641
Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

404
00:40:48,812 --> 00:40:51,246
Because I order it.

405
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,348
We can defeat anyone at sea,

406
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,650
but we'll never hold lands and castles

407
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:57,219
against mainland armies.

408
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,587
Not if our captains defy my orders,

409
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:04,126
abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

410
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:06,194
I won't apologize for
trying to rescue Theon.

411
00:41:06,296 --> 00:41:07,395
Then where is he?

412
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:09,965
Where is your kingdom?

413
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:14,069
We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

414
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:16,238
That war is over.

415
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,106
The last time we provoked them too far,

416
00:41:18,208 --> 00:41:20,876
I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

417
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,944
and knocked down our towers.

418
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:24,846
I lost two brothers that day.

419
00:41:24,948 --> 00:41:27,548
And I lost three sons.

420
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:30,852
The War of the Five Kings, they call it.

421
00:41:30,954 --> 00:41:32,854
Well, the other four are dead.

422
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:36,191
When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

423
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,126
But for now, shut your mouth and obey

424
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,896
or I will make another heir who will.

425
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,536
Let me pass.

426
00:42:24,007 --> 00:42:27,309
You fool, move aside for your king.

427
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:30,278
Haven't I always, brother?

428
00:42:40,123 --> 00:42:44,492
I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

429
00:42:44,594 --> 00:42:47,963
What is dead may never die.

430
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,134
Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

431
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,470
Aren't you supposed to repeat the words?

432
00:42:55,572 --> 00:42:58,639
You can mock our god without my help.

433
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,509
I don't mock the Drowned God.

434
00:43:01,611 --> 00:43:04,479
I am the Drowned God.

435
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,447
From Oldtown to Qarth,

436
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:10,118
when men see my sails, they pray.

437
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:22,430
You're old, brother.

438
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:24,366
You've had your time.

439
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:26,768
Now let another rule.

440
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,038
I heard you lost your mind

441
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,208
during a storm on the Jade Sea.

442
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:38,679
They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

443
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,315
They did.

444
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:44,986
And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

445
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,988
I needed silence.

446
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,525
What kind of an ironborn

447
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:54,529
loses his senses during a storm?

448
00:43:54,631 --> 00:43:58,499
I am the storm, brother.

449
00:43:58,601 --> 00:44:00,868
The first storm and the last.

450
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:04,406
And you're in my way.

451
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:46,914
Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

452
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,352
Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

453
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:52,487
Pull his bones down to your depths

454
00:44:52,589 --> 00:44:55,357
to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

455
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,758
What is dead may never die.

456
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:09,471
I'm going to find out who did this.

457
00:45:09,572 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

458
00:45:14,344 --> 00:45:17,112
I swear it by the Salt Throne.

459
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,048
The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

460
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,217
not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

461
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,185
My father would have wanted me to rule.

462
00:45:24,287 --> 00:45:27,555
Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

463
00:45:29,826 --> 00:45:31,993
Perhaps you'll win.

464
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:35,296
Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

465
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:38,333
And perhaps not.

466
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,951
Come in.

467
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:06,727
I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

468
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:08,930
You interrupt nothing.

469
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:23,778
I assume you know why I'm here.

470
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,581
I will after you tell me.

471
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:28,883
It's about the Lord Commander.

472
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:31,152
The former Lord Commander.

473
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,289
Does he have to be?

474
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,994
What are you asking?

475
00:46:43,933 --> 00:46:47,702
Do you know of any magic...

476
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:51,038
that could help him?

477
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,507
Bring him back?

478
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:55,210
If you want to help him, leave him be.

479
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,479
Can it be done?

480
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,148
There are some with this power.

481
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,817
- How?
- I don't know.

482
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:03,985
Have you seen it done?

483
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,690
I met a man who came back from the dead,

484
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:12,893
but the priest who did it...

485
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,895
it shouldn't have been possible.

486
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:18,166
But it was. It could be now.

487
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:20,568
Not for me.

488
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:26,774
Not for you?

489
00:47:30,447 --> 00:47:34,115
I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

490
00:47:34,217 --> 00:47:37,318
I saw you give birth to a
demon made of shadows.

491
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,021
Everything I believed,

492
00:47:40,123 --> 00:47:43,558
the great victory I saw in the flames,

493
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:45,226
all of it was a lie.

494
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,566
You were right all along.

495
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,402
The Lord never spoke to me.

496
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,437
Fuck him, then.

497
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,439
Fuck all of them.

498
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,878
I'm not a devout man, obviously.

499
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,315
Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

500
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,188
I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

501
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,792
I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

502
00:48:19,762 --> 00:48:21,962
I never had this gift.

503
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,998
Have you ever tried?

504
00:52:07,023 --> 00:52:09,524
Please.

505
